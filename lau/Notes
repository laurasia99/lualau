This directory contains modified source files
 - intention is to keep original sources unmodified

The changes have been made to
 - remove dynamic loading of modules (package.loadlib)
 - statically link additional modules; currently
    - LuaFileSystem
    - LuaSocket
 - use linenoise instead of readline


Technical observations
----------------------

The LuaSocket library includes .lua files as well as C code.
This code is converted during the build process on Unix systems
to create the file linit_src.ci. It consists of statically
defined strings that are linked into the lua executable, and
loaded on-demand using luaL_loadbuffer() [since the length of
string is known in advance]. This is a standard wrapper around
the lua_load() core function, which does the actual work.

To support direct loading of embedded .lua files, a dummy
module loader function is created for EACH file which just
calls luaL_loadbuffer(). This is ugly but simple.
